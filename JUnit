# JUnit & Unit testing
Unit testing tests each method for a specific class. And JUnit is a framework that does unit testing, 
it allows us to test if each method return the correct result. And it is automated.

Different folders to keep the source code and test code. The class name should be the same with Test after.
@Test annotation will tell Spring that it is a test method.

- Absence of failure is success
- check the result: assertEquals(expected, actual);
